# D3-challenge - Data Journalism and D3

* Welcome to the newsroom! Ive just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper and have been tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.
* The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
* The data set I am using is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

* So, I've created a scatter plot between the data variables Healthcare vs. Poverty using the D3 techniques i learned in class.
